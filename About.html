    <b><h2>GET TO KNOW ME</h2></b>

    <p>Hi, I'm Roxanne Lindsay Joubert and I'm an aspiring software developer. Technology has always been a passion of mine since my early days in school. When I'm not coding away at the computer, you can find me out exploring nature or visiting some of the most beautiful places around the world. Travelling is something that brings me joy and helps to broaden my horizons as well as giving me lots of inspiration for future projects! My other hobbies include playing sports such as tennis and swimming, reading books on various topics ranging from history to psychology; listening to music; cooking up delicious recipes with friends; painting landscapes in watercolour; and spending time with family & friends who are important parts of my life.</p>
